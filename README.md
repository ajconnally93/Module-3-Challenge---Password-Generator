# Module-3-Challenge---Password-Generator
Password Generator project for Module 3

The purpose of this project is to generate a random Password based on criteria inputted by the user. Do they want to include upper case characters, numbers, and/or special characters as possible characters, and how long do they want the password to be?

In completing this project I had to apply knowledge of JavaScript, specifically JavaScript functions. This was also my first use of JavaScript in using Prompts (in this case, Confirmation Prompts) to create dynamic content which can be impacted based on the desires of the end user.
